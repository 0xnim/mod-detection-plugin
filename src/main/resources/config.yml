# Mod Detector Plugin Configuration

# Mode: "whitelist" or "blacklist"
# - whitelist: Only allow listed mods/patterns, block everything else
# - blacklist: Block listed mods/patterns, allow everything else
mode: blacklist

# Whether to kick players for blocked mods
# If false, detections are still logged but players won't be kicked
# Note: All detections are always logged regardless of this setting
kick: true

# Kick message shown to players when kicked for using blocked mods
# Uses MiniMessage format: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html
# Use <mods> placeholder to show the list of detected mods
kick-message: "<red>You have been kicked for using disallowed client mods:</red><newline><yellow><mods></yellow>"

# Log format for detected mods
log-format: "[ModDetector] Player %player% sent plugin message on channel: %channel%"

# ============================================
# MOD BLOCKING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================

# Block mods by their ID (defined in mods.yml)
# Use the mod ID (e.g., "xaeros-worldmap", "jade")
# See mods.yml for all available mod IDs and their descriptions
blocked-mods:
  - xaeros-worldmap
  - xaeros-minimap
  - jade
  - journeymap

# ============================================
# CUSTOM MOD DEFINITIONS
# ============================================
# Define your own mods with the same features as built-in mods.
# Custom mods can be referenced in blocked-mods by their ID.
#
# Example:
# custom-mods:
#   my-cheat-client:
#     name: "Cheat Client"
#     description: "Known cheat client used on our server"
#     channels:
#       - "cheaty:*"
#       - "cheaty-utils:main"
#   another-mod:
#     name: "Another Mod"
#     description: "Some other mod to detect"
#     channels:
#       - "anothermod:*"
#
# Then add to blocked-mods: my-cheat-client, another-mod
custom-mods: {}

# Additional custom channel patterns to block (simple mode)
# Use * as wildcard (e.g., "someclient:*" matches any channel starting with "someclient:")
# These are checked IN ADDITION to blocked-mods above
# Note: For better organization, consider using custom-mods instead
custom-patterns: []
#  - "custommod:*"
#  - "specificchannel:data"

# ============================================
# OTHER SETTINGS
# ============================================

# Whether to log all incoming plugin messages to console (useful for discovering mod channels)
debug: false

# Log ALL channel registrations to file (not just blocked mods)
# Creates player entries in detections.json and tracks all discovered channels
# in discovered-channels.json for documentation purposes
# Use /md info <player> to view a player's registered channels
log-all-channels: false

# Notify players with permission "moddetector.notify" when a mod is detected
notify-admins: true

# Track all detections to a file (plugins/ModDetectorPlugin/detections.json)
# Records UUID, username, timestamp, and detected mods for each player
# Useful for tracking players who attempted to use blocked mods
track-detections: true
